<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Project created for the 'Web and Mobile Development' laboratory in my second year of university.

The 'dev.lib' platform is intended to be a centralized hub full of open-source assets, ready to be used by developers, designers or students in their projects, personal or commercial.

The motivation to create such a project comes from my studying experience in which I spent a lot of time creating my own assets (such as custom icons, unique buttons and animations, etc.) instead of focusing on learning new things and dedicating the time towards improvement.

While the project is intended to allow individuals to easily obtain free resources to use in their projects, that doesn't mean there aren't any similar platforms available. There are plenty, but most of them focus on only one thing (one focuses on icons, another on illustrations, and so on).

Often I found myself with a dozen of tabs opened in my browser because I needed multiple kinds of resources or most of the websites were not presenting resources that would fit my projects.

This platform could encourage individuals to create and add their own assets to the collections due to the possibility of users being able to donate to asset creators if they find the assets useful.
